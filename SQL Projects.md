In this project, I collaborated with a loan officer at First Mittagong Community Bank, to enhance the Excel workbook he uses for tracking interest rates. By applying advanced formatting techniques, I increased the workbook's usability and readability. This included updating themes, merging and centering headings, applying custom cell styles, formatting dates and numbers, and organizing data with borders and color coding. The improved workbook enables more efficient tracking and analysis of mortgage and money market rates, supporting better decision-making within the bank.

**Specific Skills Demonstrated:**

- Changed workbook themes for visual consistency.
- Merged and centered cells to create organized headings.
- Applied custom cell styles for professional formatting.
- Formatted dates to a specific day-month-year format.
- Adjusted text alignment and applied italic font styles.
- Applied Percentage and Currency number formats with precise decimal places.
- Used Format Painter to copy and paste formatting efficiently.
- Added borders and fill colors to visually organize data ranges.
- Changed worksheet tab colors for improved navigation.
