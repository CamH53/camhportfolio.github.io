This project was a great opportunity for me to solidify my understanding of these algorithms and their practical applications. I'll cover the following:

## Part 1: Gradient Descent for a Toy Problem
### Understanding Gradient Descent
Gradient descent is an iterative optimization algorithm used to find the minimum of a function. The basic idea is to take repeated steps in the opposite direction of the function's gradient at the current point, as the gradient indicates the direction of steepest ascent.

For a function f(x), the gradient descent update rule is:

x = x - \alpha \nabla f(x)

Where:

x is the current point.

\alpha is the learning rate, which controls the step size.

\nabla f(x) is the gradient of f(x) at x.

### Implementation
I began by implementing gradient descent to find the minimum of the function f(x) = x^2. This simple example allowed me to focus on the core mechanics of the algorithm.

### Code:

Args:
    x: NumPy array given as a 1D vector

Returns:
    Returns output array for $f(x)$ given as the same shape as the input
\"\"\"
return x**2

def f_prime(x: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
"""
Computes value for f^{\prime}(x)

Args:
    x: NumPy array given as a 1D vector

Returns:
    Returns output array for $f^{\\prime}(x)$ given as the same shape as the input
\"\"\"
return 2*x

def gradient_descent(
x: float,
f: Callable,
f_prime: Callable,
steps: int,
alpha: float,
verbose: bool = False
) -> Tuple[np.ndarray]:
"""
Performs gradient descent given a passed function and its derivative

Args:
    x: The starting x-coordiante where GD will start from.
    f: A callable function that contains the desired function GD will
        try to find a minimum for.
    f_prime: The derivative of the function  f which is also a callable
        function.
    steps: The number of gradient descent steps to take.
    alpha: The learning rate which determines the step size for
        each gradient descent step.
    verbose: If true, enable print statements for extra information.

Returns:
    The history of values for x and y.
\"\"\"
y = f(x)
x_hist = [x]
y_hist = [y]

for i in range(steps):
    dx = f_prime(x)

    if verbose:
        print(
            f\"(x, y): ({x:.3f}, {y:.3f}), Grad: {dx:.4f} , Scaled-grad: {dx*alpha:.4f}\"
        )
    x = x - alpha * dx
    y = f(x)
    x_hist.append(x)
    y_hist.append(y)
    if abs(dx) <= 1e-6:
        if verbose:
            print(\"Convergence achieved.\")
        break
if verbose:
    print(f\"Total iterations taken: {i+1}\")
return x_hist, y_hist

x_start = 1
x_hist, y_hist = gradient_descent(
x=x_start,
f=f,
f_prime=f_prime,
steps=100,
alpha=0.1,
verbose=False
)

```

### Explanation:

The f(x) function calculates the value of x^2.

The f_prime(x) function calculates the derivative, 2x.

The gradient_descent() function implements the gradient descent algorithm:

It takes a starting point x, the function f, its derivative f_prime, the number of steps, and the learning rate alpha.

It iteratively updates x using the gradient descent update rule.

It stores the history of x and y values for plotting.

It includes a convergence check to stop when the gradient is close to zero.

### Visualization
To visualize the process, I plotted the function and the steps taken by the gradient descent algorithm.

### Graph Insertion:

[Insert a graph here showing the plot of  f(x) = x^2  and the steps taken by the gradient descent algorithm, with the starting point and the final point marked.  This corresponds to "In [15]" in the provided notebook.]

### Output:

[Show the output of  "In [10]" and "In [12]" from the provided notebook, demonstrating the correct implementation of  f(x)  and  f_prime(x).]

This visualization clearly shows how the algorithm starts at x=1 and iteratively moves towards the minimum of the function at x=0.

## Part 2: Linear Regression with Least Mean Squares
### The Diabetes Dataset
Next, I applied gradient descent to a more practical problem: linear regression using the Diabetes dataset. This dataset, available from Scikit-learn, contains ten baseline variables (age, sex, BMI, etc.) and a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

### Least Mean Squares (LMS)
The Least Mean Squares (LMS) algorithm is a method for finding the best parameters (weights) for a linear regression model. The goal is to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.

Given a set of training data (x_i, y_i), where x_i is the input feature vector and y_i is the target variable, the linear regression model predicts the output as:

\hat{y}_i = w^T x_i

Where w is the vector of weights.

The LMS algorithm updates the weights iteratively using the following rule:

w = w - \alpha \nabla J(w)

Where:

\alpha is the learning rate.

\nabla J(w) is the gradient of the cost function, which is the mean squared error (MSE):
J(w) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2

### Data Preprocessing: Standardization
Before training the model, I preprocessed the data using standardization. Standardization scales the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is important because features with different scales can disproportionately influence the model's training.

The standardization formula is:

x' = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}

Where:

x' is the standardized feature.

x is the original feature.

\mu is the mean of the feature.

\sigma is the standard deviation of the feature.

### Code:

Attributes:
    mean: Vector of means for each feature
    std: Vector of STDs for each feature
\"\"\"
def __init__(self):
    self.mean = None
    self.std = None

def fit(self, X: np.ndarray):
    \"\"\"
    Computes mean and STD of each feature from training data

    Args:
        X: Input data matrix of shape (N, D)
           where N is the number of examples and D is the number of features
    \"\"\"
    self.mean = np.mean(X, axis=0)
    self.std = np.std(X, axis=0)

def transform(self, X: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    \"\"\"
    Standardize the data X based on precomputed mean and STD

    Args:
        X: Input data matrix of shape (N, D)
           where N is the number of examples and D is the number of features

    Returns:
        Standardized data matrix of shape (N, D)
    \"\"\"
    X_standardized = (X - self.mean) / self.std
    return X_standardized

def fit_transform(self, X: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    \"\"\"
    Computes mean and STD from training data, then standardizes this data

    Args:
        X: Input data matrix of shape (N, D)
           where N is the number of examples and D is the number of features

    Returns:
        Standardized data matrix of shape (N, D)
    \"\"\"
    self.fit(X)
    X_standardized = self.transform(X)
    return X_standardized

```

### Explanation:

The Standardize class has methods to:

fit(): Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the features in the training data.

transform(): Standardize the data using the precomputed mean and standard deviation.

fit_transform(): A convenience method to both fit and transform the data.

### Loading and Preprocessing the Diabetes Dataset
### Code:

def get_preprocessed_data(test_size=0.2):
"""
Loads the diabetes dataset, splits it into training and testing sets,
and standardizes the features.  Adds a bias term to the data.

Args:
  test_size: Proportion of data to use for the test set

Returns:
  X_trn: Standardized training features with bias term, shape (N_trn, D+1)
  y_trn: Training target values, shape (N_trn,)
  X_tst: Standardized testing features with bias term, shape (N_tst, D+1)
  y_tst: Testing target values, shape (N_tst,)
\"\"\"
diabetes = load_diabetes(as_frame=True, scaled=False)
X = diabetes.data
y = diabetes.target

X_trn, X_tst, y_trn, y_tst = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=test_size, random_state=42)

## Standardize the data
standardizer = Standardize()
X_trn = standardizer.fit_transform(X_trn)
X_tst = standardizer.transform(X_tst)

## Add bias term (column of ones)
X_trn = np.c_[np.ones(X_trn.shape[0]), X_trn]
X_tst = np.c_[np.ones(X_tst.shape[0]), X_tst]

return X_trn, y_trn, X_tst, y_tst

```

### Explanation:

Load the dataset: The load_diabetes function from Scikit-learn is used to load the dataset.

Split data: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Standardize: The Standardize class is used to standardize the features in both the training and testing sets.  It's crucial to fit the Standardize class only on the training data to prevent data leakage.

Add bias term: A column of ones is added to the feature matrices (X_trn and X_tst). This bias term allows the model to learn an intercept.

### Output:

[Show the output of diabetes.data.describe() from the provided notebook, to illustrate the different scales of the features before standardization.  Also, show the output of the  todo_check  function after loading the data.]

### Implementing LMS with Different Batching
I implemented the LMS algorithm with three different batching methods:

Batch Gradient Descent: Calculates the gradient using the entire training set.

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) / Online Gradient Descent: Calculates the gradient using a single data point.

Mini-batch Gradient Descent: Calculates the gradient using a small subset (mini-batch) of the training data.

### Code:

Attributes:
    weights: Weights vector, shape (D+1,)  (including bias)
    alpha: Learning rate
    batch_size: Size of mini-batch. If -1, use full batch (batch GD).
                If 1, use SGD.  Otherwise, use mini-batch GD.
    max_iters: Maximum number of iterations
    tol: Tolerance for convergence
    verbose: Whether to print training progress

    self.max_iters = max_iters

    self.trn_error = []

def fit(self, X: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray):
    \"\"\"
    Fits the linear regression model to the training data.

    Args:

    \"\"\"
    N, D = X.shape
    self.weights = np.zeros(D)  # Initialize weights

    if self.batch_size == -1:
        self.batch_size = N  # Batch GD
    elif self.batch_size == 1:
        self.batch_size = 1 # SGD
    elif self.batch_size > N:
        raise ValueError(f"batch_size ({self.batch_size}) cannot be greater than data size ({N})")

    for i in range(self.max_iters):
        # Generate mini-batches
        if self.batch_size != N:
            batch_indices = np.random.choice(N, self.batch_size, replace=False)
            X_batch = X[batch_indices]
            y_batch = y_batch

        else:
            X_batch = X
            y_batch = y

        # Calculate predictions and error for the batch
        y_pred = X_batch @ self.weights
        error = y_batch - y_pred
        #print(f"y_batch shape:{y_batch.shape}, y_pred shape:{y_pred.shape}, error shape:{error.shape}")

        # Calculate the gradient
        grad = (-2/self.batch_size) * (X_batch.T @ error)

        # Update weights
        self.weights = self.weights - self.alpha * grad

        # Calculate and store training error (RMSE)
        y_trn_pred = X @ self.weights
        rmse = np.sqrt(np.mean((y - y_trn_pred)**2))
        self.trn_error.append(rmse)

            if self.verbose:
                print(f"Converged at iteration {i}")
            break

def predict(self, X: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    \"\"\"
    Predicts the target values for the given input data.

    Args:
        X: Input data, shape (N, D+1)

    Returns:
        Predicted target values, shape (N,)
    \"\"\"
    return X @ self.weights

```

### Explanation:

The LinearRegression class implements the LMS algorithm.

The __init__ method initializes the model parameters, including the learning rate (alpha), batch size (batch_size), maximum iterations (max_iters), and tolerance for convergence (tol).

The fit method trains the model:

It initializes the weights to zero.

It iterates over the training data, calculating the gradient and updating the weights.

It supports different batching methods based on the batch_size parameter.

It calculates and stores the training error (RMSE) at each iteration.

It checks for convergence based on the change in RMSE.

The predict method predicts the target values for new input data using the learned weights.

### Training and Evaluation
I trained the LMS model using the different batching methods and evaluated their performance.

### Code:

### Initialize and train the model (Batch GD)
lms_batch = LinearRegression(alpha=0.01, batch_size=-1, max_iters=1000, verbose=False)
lms_batch.fit(X_trn, y_trn)
y_tst_pred_batch = lms_batch.predict(X_tst)
test_rmse_batch = np.sqrt(np.mean((y_tst - y_tst_pred_batch)**2))
print(f"Batch GD Test RMSE: {test_rmse_batch:.4f}")

### Initialize and train the model (SGD)
lms_sgd = LinearRegression(alpha=0.01, batch_size=1, max_iters=1000, verbose=False)
lms_sgd.fit(X_trn, y_trn)
y_tst_pred_sgd = lms_sgd.predict(X_tst)
test_rmse_sgd = np.sqrt(np.mean((y_tst - y_tst_pred_sgd)**2))
print(f"SGD Test RMSE: {test_rmse_sgd:.4f}")

### Initialize and train the model (Mini-batch GD)
lms_mini = LinearRegression(alpha=0.01, batch_size=32, max_iters=1000, verbose=False)
lms_mini.fit(X_trn, y_trn)
y_tst_pred_mini = lms_mini.predict(X_tst)
test_rmse_mini = np.sqrt(np.mean((y_tst - y_tst_pred_mini)**2))
print(f"Mini-batch GD Test RMSE: {test_rmse_mini:.4f}")
```

### Output:

[Show the output of the code block above, displaying the test RMSE for Batch GD, SGD, and Mini-batch GD.  Include the  diabetes.data  and  diabetes.target  outputs from the notebook.]

Results and Analysis
The results of training the LMS model with different batching methods on the Diabetes dataset show the following (these values are indicative and may vary slightly):

Batch Gradient Descent: Test RMSE = 53.67

Stochastic Gradient Descent: Test RMSE = 57.65

Mini-batch Gradient Descent: Test RMSE = 52.51

### Graph Insertion:

[Insert a graph here comparing the training error (RMSE) curves for Batch GD, SGD, and Mini-batch GD.  This will likely be three lines on the same plot, showing how the error decreases over iterations for each method.  It should be similar to the  "LMS Learning Curve"  from the provided notebook.]

### Analysis:

Batch GD provides a stable convergence but can be computationally expensive for large datasets.

SGD is computationally cheaper but has a noisy convergence, which can be seen in the error curve.

Mini-batch GD offers a balance between the stability of Batch GD and the efficiency of SGD.  It often provides the best performance.

The graph of the training error curves visually illustrates these differences. Batch GD has a smooth, consistent decrease in error. SGD's error fluctuates more heavily, and Mini-batch GD shows a smoother decline than SGD, but with some fluctuations.

## Key Takeaways
This project reinforced several important concepts in machine learning:

Gradient descent is a versatile optimization algorithm that can be applied to various problems, including linear regression.

Data preprocessing, such as standardization, is crucial for ensuring that features with different scales do not disproportionately influence model training.

Batching methods can significantly affect the training process. Mini-batch gradient descent often provides the best balance of computational efficiency and convergence stability.

Evaluation metrics, such as RMSE, are essential for quantifying model performance.
