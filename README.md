## Projects
### Improving an Online Statistics Course with Custom Metrics
## 2024 Duke DataFest
[Event Details]([https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048](https://dukestatsci.github.io/datafest/))

Designed and implemented several statistical measurement indexes, such as persistence, accuracy, and efficiency, based on the data provided by the course platform and our own variables. Applied **ANOVA** analysis with Kruskal Result in Python’s Pandas to test the significance of our indexes and to identify the factors that influenced them. Used Tableau Dashboarding to create visualizations of our results and to generate actionable recommendations for improving the course content and structure, such as adding video questions, reorganizing question distributions, and clustering students into groups that would benefit them individually.
