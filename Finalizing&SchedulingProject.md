# Finalizing Projects and Scheduling Worksheets for Facilities Management

In this project, I worked as the operations manager to finalize project data and facilities usage scheduling using Excel. The task involved working across two worksheets: Projects and Scheduling.

On the Projects worksheet, I formatted text, entered new data, used AutoFit for column adjustments, and leveraged Excel's Flash Fill feature to auto-populate a series of codes. I then hid unnecessary columns for a cleaner presentation.

Projects Worksheet Skills Demonstrated:
- Increased font size to improve readability.
- Entered data into a table and used AutoFit to adjust column width.
- Used Flash Fill to auto-populate a series of values.
- Hid columns to declutter the worksheet.

In the Scheduling worksheet, I updated the week's header, rearranged content for better organization, and applied the COUNT function to calculate project bookings. Additional modifications included adjusting zoom, changing the page orientation to portrait, and organizing worksheets by hiding the Facilities sheet and creating a placeholder Contractors sheet.

Scheduling Worksheet Skills Demonstrated:
- Updated cell content to reflect a specific date.
- Rearranged content using cut and paste.
- Used the COUNT function to calculate data.
- Adjusted worksheet zoom and page orientation.
- Moved and hid worksheets for better workbook organization.
- Created and renamed a new worksheet for future use.
