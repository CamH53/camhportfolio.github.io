# Optimization for Loan Interest Rate Tracking: 

In this project, I enhanced a loan officer's Excel workbook used for tracking interest rates. By applying advanced formatting techniques, I increased the workbook's usability and readability. This included updating themes, merging and centering headings, applying custom cell styles, formatting dates and numbers, and organizing data with borders and color coding. The improved workbook enables more efficient tracking and analysis of mortgage and money market rates, supporting better decision-making within the bank.

In the Mortgage worksheet, I applied several formatting techniques to improve the organization and clarity of interest rate data. This involved changing the workbook theme, merging and centering key headings, and applying custom FM Heading and FM Subheading cell styles for a polished look. I formatted the effective date using a specialized date format and adjusted text alignment to enhance readability. The mortgage rate table was customized by applying bold text, Blue-Gray font color, and merging cells for a cleaner layout. Number formats were updated to display percentages with two decimal places and precise figures with three decimal places, and borders were added for clear separation of data. I also applied a green accent fill to highlight key ranges, making important information stand out.

In the Money Market worksheet, I mirrored the formatting structure of the Mortgage worksheet to ensure uniformity across the workbook. I merged and centered key headings, applied the FM Heading and FM Subheading styles, and copied over content and formatting for the effective date range from the Mortgage worksheet. The money market rate table was formatted with Currency and Percentage number formats, each set to display two decimal places for accuracy. To further distinguish the two worksheets, I changed the tab colors to purple for the Mortgage worksheet and dark red for the Money Market worksheet.
